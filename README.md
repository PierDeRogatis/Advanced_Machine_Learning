Grade: Distinction


COURSE DESCRIPTION

Machine learning refers to the automated detection of meaningful patterns in data. Not only are machine learning techniques ubiquitous today in that they are behind many of the technologies we use in our daily lives, but they have also become an important part of the social scientist’s toolkit, especially since more and more social science data are now available in electronic form. A common feature of all applications of machine learning is the use of computer algorithms that can “learn” and adapt. The goal of this course is to introduce participants to a variety of widely used supervised and unsupervised machine learning methods. After discussing the fundamental concepts of machine learning, the course continues with supervised learning methods (e.g., regularization, tree boosting, support vector machines, and neural networks), then turns to unsupervised learning methods (e.g., principal components analysis and clustering methods), and lastly covers flexible model averaging techniques (e.g., Bayesian model averaging).

COURSE OUTLINE

Day 1 – Statistical Learning; Resampling Methods. Goals and challenges of machine learning; supervised and unsupervised learning; regression and classification problems; bias-variance trade-off and the problem of overfitting; model assessment and selection; cross-validation (k-fold cross-validation, leave-one-out cross-validation); bootstrapping.

Day 2 – Linear Methods for Regression. Linear regression and least squares; subset selection (best subset selection, stepwise selection); shrinkage methods (ridge regression, lasso, elastic net).
